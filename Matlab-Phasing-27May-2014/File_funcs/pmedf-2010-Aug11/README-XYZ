Results from playing with matrix dimensions and imaging it
by means of various drawers -- and you want to get always
the same image.

===========================================================

I use
	[h, a] = pmedf_read('image.edf');

Then imaging from Octave:

	imagesc(rot90(a)); axis xy; colorbar

	pmimage(rot90(a)); axis xy; colorbar

	b=fliplr(a); imagesc(b'); axis xy; colorbar % b is cartesian

	savegpbin(1:rows(a), 1:columns(a), fliplr(a), 'a.gpbin');
	or
	savegpbin(1:rows(b), 1:columns(b), fliplr(b), 'a.gpbin');
		gnuplot> set autoscale fix; plot 'a.gpbin' binary with image

is exactly that from
	zimg
	onze
	ImageJ
and all give the same image on the screen.

Further, accessing fields in Octave:
	* x are rows, y are columns
	* x goes from left to right
	* y goes from top to down
	* a(x1:x2, y1:y2) selects what you expect, i.e. the frame as indicated
	  by ImageJ, Irfan, PMview

These x and y directions are those shown in ImageJ and Irfan.

Thus we are compatible also to my adAnaRock, adGetRock, etc. scripts.

Notes: Irfan and ImageJ count pixels from 0, PMview from 1.
And Octave from 1 too.
adAnaRock, adGetRock et al from 0.
